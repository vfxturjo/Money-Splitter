		// Simpler approach: the stack stores the explicit "back" destinations.
		// When on page X, and we set its back target to Y, Y is pushed.
		// No, that's not right.

		// Let's make `historyStack` represent the linear path taken *to* the current page,
		// but only the ones we want in our controlled back-flow.

		// When navigating TO `currentPagePath`, we specify where its back button should lead.
		// This "back destination" is effectively the "previous" page in our controlled flow.

				// We need to ensure the `destination` itself is a valid registered entry.
				// For now, let's assume `destination` was a previously registered page.
				// This implies `registerPage` should be called *before* navigating to `currentPagePath`
				// or upon arrival, it defines "where back goes from here".

				// Let's refine: The stack stores the sequence of pages that form the "up" navigation.
				// When on page 'C', and its back button should go to 'B', then 'B' should be on the stack.
				// And if 'B's back button goes to 'A', then 'A' is before 'B'.
				// So: [A, B] is the stack when on page C. Back goes to B. Then stack is [A]. Back goes to A.

				// When `registerPage(currentPagePath, backDestinationPath)` is called:
				// `backDestinationPath` is the page the back button on `currentPagePath` should navigate to.
				// We need to construct the stack such that `backDestinationPath` is the top effective item
				// to go back to *after* `currentPagePath` is conceptually added.

				// Let's consider the `backDestinationPath` as the "parent" in the desired flow.
				// The stack will store the ancestry.

					// If stack is empty and we're not going back to home, prime with home.
					this.historyStack.push({ path: this.homePath });
				}

				// If the last item on stack is not the desired `backDestinationPath`, update.
				// This logic needs to be robust. If `backDestinationPath` is /a/b, and current stack is /a/c,
				// we should probably replace /a/c with /a/b if /a is common.

				// Simpler: Each page defines its explicit back target.
				// The "stack" will just be a single $state variable holding the *next* back target.
				// This simplifies the class significantly. Let's pivot to this.
				// The user wants a *stack* behavior to "gradually lead to the home page".

				// Reverting to a stack of "where to go back to".
				// When you are on page P, and you set its back URL to B.
				// The stack should represent the path *to* P.
				// If you came from A to B to P, stack might be [A, B]. Back from P goes to B.

				// Let's try this: `historyStack` stores the designated "back" locations.
				// When `setBackPath(path)` is called from the current page, `path` is where back should go.
				this.historyStack = [{ path: destination }]; // For now, a simple override. We'll make it a stack.
			}
		}
		// This is still not quite right for a stack that "gradually leads home".

		// --- Let's use a proper stack representing the explicit back journey ---
		// When a page loads and sets its back target:
		// - If the target is home, clear stack and push home.
		// - Else, push the target onto the stack.
		// This means the stack always reflects the "parent" path.
